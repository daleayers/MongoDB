# MongoDB

For me this was a very challenging class because of the limited time that I had to study the material. 
Understanding CRUD and linking Python to MongoDB was a very interesting experience and the advantages are endless when doing it this way because of the amazing
flexibility that you have in the different ways that you can do it. The techniques that I learned from this class is that the project isn't always what you thought it was originally. As a computer scientist its important to understand that we are problem solvers. People come to us with what they have in their head and it's up to use to turn what they have in their head into reality.
